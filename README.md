This is a little side project that I am creating to learn database design. This also plays a role in my understanding of Rust and lower level design and programing. 
If there is anything that seems a bit off, its probably due to me not knowing that there was a better way as I am still learning. 

I am taking reference to many different resources to learn. Current I have referenced:
- Tokio's [Mini Redis](https://github.com/tokio-rs/mini-redis/) project
- James Smith's [ Build Your Own Database From Scratch in Go ](https://build-your-own.org/database/) and [Build Your Own Redis with C/C++ ](https://build-your-own.org/redis/)

## Goals
My goals currently are to make an In-Memory Key value database.

Im not too worried at the moment with ACID compliance, clustering or persistence. 
_Although that would be an interesting problem to solve_. Also I want to get better at my Rust capabilities. 

Threading right now is not a requirement but will be looked at so that I can better my skills with it.
